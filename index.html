            Billie Jean King, born on the 22nd of November, 1943, was a
            remarkable figure in both sports and aviation. Her parents were a
            shoemaker and a firefighter. Growing up in Long Beach, California,
            she showed an early interest in tennis and airplanes, and would go
            on to break both sports and aviation records.

          <p>
            In 1945 Billie Jean King played her first game of tennis at the age
            of 2. At the age of 8, Billie Jean King won her first tennis
            tournament, the "Little League of Champions," showcasing her natural
            talent for the sport. She trained rigorously at a local tennis club
            and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the youngest player to
            win the Wimbledon Championships in 1955!

            The "Battle of the Sexes" was a famous tennis match between
            29-year-old Billie Jean King and 55-year-old Bobby Riggs. King
            impressed the world when she won against the previously undefeated
            Riggs, proving that women can play tennis as well as men.

            While Billie Jean King is more widely known for her accomplishments
            in tennis, she is also an innovator in aviation. She obtained her
            pilot's license at the age of 16 and flew her own plane to
            tournaments across the country. Her unique approach to combining
            tennis and aviation made her a beloved figure among fans and pilots
            alike. In 1967, Billie Jean King made history by becoming the first
            person to play tennis in zero gravity during a special exhibition
            match aboard a NASA spacecraft. Although the match ended in a tie
            due to the floating tennis ball, it captured the imagination of
            people worldwide.
